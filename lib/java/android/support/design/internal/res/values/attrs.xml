    <!-- Internal flag used to denote that a style uses new attributes defined by
         Theme.MaterialComponents, and that the component should check via ThemeEnforcement that the
         client's app theme inherits from Theme.MaterialComponents.

         Not all usages of new attributes are problematic in the context of a legacy app theme. You
         should only use this flag if a particular usage is known to cause a visual glitch or crash.
         For example, tinting a vector drawable with a non-existent theme attribute is known to
         crash on pre-21 devices. -->

        The initial length in a percentage format relative to its parent. This is similar to the
        flex-basis property in the original CSS specification.
        (https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-basis-property)
        But unlike the flex-basis property, this attribute only accepts a value in fraction
        (percentage), whereas flex-basis property accepts width values such as 1em, 10px and
        the 'content' string.
        But specifying initial fixed width values can be done by specifying width values in
        layout_width (or layout_height, varies depending on the flexDirection). Also the same
        effect can be done by specifying "wrap_content" in layout_width (or layout_height) if
        developers want to achieve the same effect as 'content'.
        Thus, this attribute only accepts fraction values, which can't be done through
        layout_width (or layout_height) for simplicity.

        This attribute forces a flex line wrapping. i.e. if this is set to true for a
        flex item, the item will become the first item of a flex line. (A wrapping happens
        regardless of the flex items being processed in the the previous flex line)
        This attribute is ignored if the flex_wrap attribute is set to nowrap.
        The equivalent attribute isn't defined in the original CSS Flexible Box Module
        specification, but having this attribute is useful for Android developers to flatten
        the layouts when building a grid like layout or for a situation where developers want
        to put a new flex line to make a semantic difference from the previous one, etc.

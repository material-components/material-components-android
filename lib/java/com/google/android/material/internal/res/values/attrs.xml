    <!-- Internal flag used to denote that a style uses new attributes defined by
         Theme.MaterialComponents, and that the component should check via ThemeEnforcement that the
         client's app theme inherits from Theme.MaterialComponents.

         Not all usages of new attributes are problematic in the context of a legacy app theme. You
         should only use this flag if a particular usage is known to cause a visual glitch or crash.
         For example, tinting a vector drawable with a non-existent theme attribute is known to
         crash on pre-21 devices. -->

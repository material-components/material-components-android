   * <p>CornerTreatments are assumed to have an origin of (0, 0) (i.e. they represent the top-left
   * corner), and are automatically rotated and scaled as necessary when applied to other corners.
   *
   * @param angle the angle of the corner, typically 90 degrees.
   * @param interpolation the interpolation of the corner treatment. Ranges between 0 (none) and 1
   *     (fully) interpolated. Custom corner treatments can implement interpolation to support shape
   *     transition between two arbitrary states. Typically, a value of 0 indicates that the custom
   *     corner treatment is not rendered (i.e. that it is a 90 degree angle), and a value of 1
   *     indicates that the treatment is fully rendered. Animation between these two values can
   *     "heal" or "reveal" a corner treatment.
   * @param shapePath the {@link ShapePath} that this treatment should write to.

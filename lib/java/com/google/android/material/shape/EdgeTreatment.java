   * to other edges. Only the horizontal, top EdgeTreatment needs to be defined in order to apply it

   *
   * @param length the length of the edge.
   * @param interpolation the interpolation of the edge treatment. Ranges between 0 (none) and 1
   *     (fully) interpolated. Custom edge treatments can implement interpolation to support shape
   *     transition between two arbitrary states. Typically, a value of 0 indicates that the custom
   *     edge treatment is not rendered (i.e. that it is a straight line), and a value of 1
   *     indicates that the treatment is fully rendered. Animation between these two values can
   *     "heal" or "reveal" an edge treatment.
   * @param shapePath the {@link ShapePath} that this treatment should write to.

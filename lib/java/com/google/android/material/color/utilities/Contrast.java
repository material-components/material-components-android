  // asked for.

  // number of colors. Display spaces include sRGB, more commonly understood  as RGB/HSL/HSV/HSB.
  // Gamut mapping is undefined and not defined by the color space. Any gamut mapping algorithm must
  // choose how to sacrifice accuracy in hue, saturation, and/or lightness.
  //
  // A principled solution is to maintain lightness, thus maintaining contrast/a11y, maintain hue,
  // thus maintaining aesthetic intent, and reduce chroma until the color is in gamut.
  //
  // HCT chooses this solution, but, that doesn't mean it will _exactly_ matched desired lightness,

  // display color spaces, methods that take a contrast ratio and luminance, and return a luminance
  // that reaches that contrast ratio for the input luminance, purposefully darken/lighten their
  // result such that the desired contrast ratio will be reached even if inaccuracy is introduced.
  //
  // 0.4 is generous, ex. HCT requires much less delta. It was chosen because it provides a rough

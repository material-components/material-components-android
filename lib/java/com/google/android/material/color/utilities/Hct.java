/**
 * A color system built using CAM16 hue and chroma, and L* from L*a*b*.
 *
 * <p>Using L* creates a link between the color system, contrast, and thus accessibility. Contrast
 * ratio depends on relative luminance, or Y in the XYZ color space. L*, or perceptual luminance can
 * be calculated from Y.
 *
 * <p>Unlike Y, L* is linear to human perception, allowing trivial creation of accurate color tones.
 *
 * <p>Unlike contrast ratio, measuring contrast in L* is linear, and simple to calculate. A
 * difference of 40 in HCT tone guarantees a contrast ratio >= 3.0, and a difference of 50
 * guarantees a contrast ratio >= 4.5.

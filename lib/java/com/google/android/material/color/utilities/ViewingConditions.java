   *     the room where the color is viewed. Can be calculated from lux by multiplying lux by
   *     0.0586. default = 11.72, or 200 lux.

   *     L*a*b*. default = 50.0
   * @param surround A general description of the lighting surrounding the color. 0 is pitch dark,
   *     like watching a movie in a theater. 1.0 is a dimly light room, like watching TV at home at
   *     night. 2.0 means there is no difference between the lighting on the color and around it.
   *     default = 2.0
   * @param discountingIlluminant Whether the eye accounts for the tint of the ambient lighting,
   *     such as knowing an apple is still red in green light. default = false, the eye does not
   *     perform this process on self-luminous objects like displays.

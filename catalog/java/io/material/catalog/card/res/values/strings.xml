    Cards represent entry points into deeper levels of detail or navigation, such as an album in
    Music or an upcoming vacation in Trips. They can be used in a grid, carousel, or feed to
    contain groups of individual packaged information.
  </string>
  <string name="cat_card_spacing_desc">
    Cards on mobile default to 8dp margins. layout_margin needs to be set directly on a View in its
    layout and will not work when included as part of a style.

    CardView from the Support Library works side-by-side with MaterialCardView. These cards default
    to Material 1 styles and support fewer style attributes than MaterialCardView.
  </string>
  <string name="cat_card_style_only_desc">
    MaterialCardView uses the correct styles by default and makes use of additional style attributes
    that are not provided in CardView. If you do not need to use the new style attributes, you can
    use MaterialCardView in your layout, or apply a style tag to a CardView. We recommend using
    the MaterialCardView class for the latest Material designs and maximum flexibility in your UI.

  <!-- This purpose of this attr is to allow a different Toolbar style based on the Catalog app.
       The reason we can't set toolbarStyle globally in the Catalog's app theme is because the
       android:theme attribute, which is in the Toolbar style, does not get applied to the Toolbar
       when the style is set globally, due to how ThemeOverlays get created and resolved. So,
       instead on each Toolbar we have to explicitly set style="?attr/catalogToolbarStyle" or
       style="?attr/catalogToolbarWithCloseButtonStyle" if the toolbar contains a close button. -->

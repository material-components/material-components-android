# Using a Snapshot Version of the Library

If you would like to depend on the cutting edge version of the MDC-Android
library, you can use the
[snapshot versions](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/packages/81484)
that are published daily via
[GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages).

To do so, you need to
[create a GitHub access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token)
with the `read:packages` scope, and add the following to your `build.gradle`
Maven repositories, replacing `<github_username>` and `<github_access_token>`
with your credentials:

```groovy
maven {
    name = "MaterialSnapshots"
    url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/material-components/material-components-android")
    credentials {
        username = "<github_username>"
        password = "<github_access_token>"
    }
}
```

Then you can use a snapshot version by adding a
`com.google.android.material:material:<version>-SNAPSHOT` dependency as per
usual (see latest release
[here](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/packages/81484/versions)).
This will fetch the latest snapshot version, which your Gradle build won't
cache. If you build after a new version has been published, that version will be
used.

See the offical doc on
[Configuring Gradle for use with GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages)
for additional information.

If you prefer to depend on a specific snapshot version, you can add
`com.google.android.material:material:<version>-<uniqueversion>`, where
`<uniqueversion>` is a combination of the date, a timestamp, and a counter (see
all versions
[here](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/packages/81484/versions)).

You can also find the list of versions through the
[GraphQL explorer](https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/) with the following
query:

```graphql
{
  node(id: "MDE0OlBhY2thZ2VWZXJzaW9uMjMyNDc2OQ==") {
    ... on PackageVersion {
      id
      version
      files(last: 12, orderBy: {field: CREATED_AT, direction: ASC}) {
        nodes {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you could use
[JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#material-components/material-components-android)
to generate library releases based on specific commits.

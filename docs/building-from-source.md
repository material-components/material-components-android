# Building From the Latest Source

If you'll be contributing to the library, or need a version newer than what has
been released, Material Components for Android can also be built from source.
To do so:

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android.git
```

Then, build the library's AARs using Gradle:

```sh
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

**Note:** To make sure that your local version of MDC-Android will get used and
not conflict with existing releases, consider changing the version specified as
`mdcLibraryVersion` in the library's top-level `build.gradle` file to something
unique before running the above command.

This will output AARs and Maven artifacts for each of the library's modules to
the local Maven repository on your machine (`~/.m2/repository`).

To use the AARs in your app locally, add `mavenLocal()` as a repository in your
project's top-level `build.gradle` file. Finally, add the MDC-Android library
dependency as you would normally, using the version specified as
`mdcLibraryVersion` in the library's top-level `build.gradle` file.

# Floating action button (FAB) menu

A
[floating action button (FAB) menu](https://m3.material.io/components/fab-menu/overview)
opens from a FAB to show 2â€“6 related actions floating on screen. There is one
FAB menu size for all sizes of FABs.

Fab menu is not used with extended FABs and it is available in primary,
secondary, and tertiary color sets.

Use the FAB menu to show multiple related actions in a prominent, expressive
style. It should always appear in the same place as the FAB that opened it.

## Design & API documentation

*   [Material 3 (M3) spec](https://m3.material.io/components/fab-menu/overview)
*   [API reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary?hl=en#FloatingActionButtonMenu\(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Horizontal,kotlin.Function1\))

## Anatomy

More details on anatomy items in the
[component guidelines](https://m3.material.io/components/fab-menu/guidelines#eee40b5b-ce91-458e-9005-19db241f074c).

## M3 Expressive update

The FAB menu adds more options to the FAB. It should replace the speed dial and
any usage of stacked small FABs.

The FAB menu uses contrasting color and large items to focus attention. It can
open from any size FAB.

**New component added to catalog:**

*   One menu size that pairs with any FAB
*   Replaces any usage of stacked small FABs

**Color:**

*   Contrasting close button and item colors
*   Supports dynamic color
*   Compatible with any FAB color style

## Code implementation (via Compose interop)

The FAB menu component is currently not available as a native **Views**
component. This doc shows how to use the **Compose** FAB menu component via the
Views <-> Compose interop.

Compose API and source code:

*   `FloatingActionButtonMenu`
    *   [API documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary?hl=en#FloatingActionButtonMenu\(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Horizontal,kotlin.Function1\))
    *   [Source code](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/material3/material3/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/FloatingActionButtonMenu.kt)
    *   [Sample code](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/material3/material3/samples/src/main/java/androidx/compose/material3/samples/FloatingActionButtonMenuSamples.kt)

First, follow the
[Get started with Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/documentation)
guide to get your app set up with Compose, if it isn't already.

Next, in order to use the Compose `FloatingActionButtonMenu` component make sure
to add a dependency on the
[Compose Material 3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3)
library to your app.

Finally, add a `ComposeView` to your app by following the
[Using Compose in Views](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/migrate/interoperability-apis/compose-in-views)
interop guide and use the Compose `FloatingActionButtonMenu` within your
`ComposeView`, by referring to the
[API documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary?hl=en#FloatingActionButtonMenu\(kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.Alignment.Horizontal,kotlin.Function1\))
and
[sample code](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/material3/material3/samples/src/main/java/androidx/compose/material3/samples/FloatingActionButtonMenuSamples.kt).

For a working demo of using the Compose FAB menu in a Views app via interop,
take a look at
[FabMenuDemoFragment.kt](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/catalog/java/io/material/catalog/fab/FabMenuDemoFragment.kt)
in the Material Android Views Catalog app. This demo also shows how to handle
light, dark, and dynamic color schemes to ensure the Compose
`FloatingActionButtonMenu` looks correct within the Views app.

**Note:** In order to have a consistent visual experience between the Compose
FAB menu and your app, make sure to set up the `MaterialTheme` or
`MaterialExpressiveTheme` in your `ComposeView` to match the theming of your
Views app.

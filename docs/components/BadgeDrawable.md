# `BadgeDrawable`

## Design and API Documentation

*   [Google Material3 Spec](https://material.io/components/badges/overview)
*   [API reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/badge/package-summary)

## Using badges

Badge                                         | Badge with number                                    | Badge with a maximum character count

**Note:** This component is still under development and may not support the full
range of customization Material Android components generally support, for
instance, themed attributes.

A `BadgeDrawable` represents dynamic information such as a number of pending
requests in a [`BottomNavigationView`](BottomNavigation.md) or
[`TabLayout`](Tabs.md).

## Usage

API and source code:

*   `BadgeDrawable`
    *   [Class definition](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/badge/BadgeDrawable)
    *   [Class source](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/badge/BadgeDrawable.java)
*   `BadgeUtils`
    *   [Class definition](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/badge/BadgeUtils)
    *   [Class source](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/lib/java/com/google/android/material/badge/BadgeUtils.java)

Create an instance of `BadgeDrawable` by calling `create(Context)` or
`createFromAttributes(Context, AttributeSet, int, int)}`.

The approach used to add and display a `BadgeDrawable` on top of its anchor view
depends on the API level:

In API 18+ (APIs supported by
[ViewOverlay](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewOverlay))

1.  Add `BadgeDrawable` as a
    [ViewOverlay](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewOverlay)
    to the desired anchor view.
2.  Update the `BadgeDrawable`'s coordinates (center and bounds) based on its
    anchor view using `#updateBadgeCoordinates(View)`.

Both steps have been encapsulated in a util method:

```java
BadgeUtils.attachBadgeDrawable(badgeDrawable, anchor);
```

In Pre API-18

1.  Set `BadgeDrawable` as the foreground of the anchor view's `FrameLayout`
    ancestor.
2.  Update the `BadgeDrawable`'s coordinates (center and bounds) based on its
    anchor view, relative to its `FrameLayout` ancestor's coordinate space.

Option 1: `BadgeDrawable` will dynamically create and wrap the anchor view in a
`FrameLayout`, then insert the `FrameLayout` into the original anchor view
position in the view hierarchy. Same syntax as API 18+

```java
BadgeUtils.attachBadgeDrawable(badgeDrawable, anchor);
```

Option 2: If you do not want `BadgeDrawable` to modify your view hierarchy, you
can specify a `FrameLayout` to display the badge instead.

```java
BadgeUtils.attachBadgeDrawable(badgeDrawable, anchor, anchorFrameLayoutParent);
```

### `BadgeDrawable` Gravity Modes

`BadgeDrawable` offers two gravity modes to control how the badge aligns with
its anchor view. By default, (`TOP_END`) badge aligns with the top and end edges
of the anchor (with some offsets). Alternatively, you can use `TOP_START` to
align the badge with the top and start edges of the anchor. Note that
`BOTTOM_START` and `BOTTOM_END` are deprecated and not recommended for use.

### `BadgeDrawable` placement and offsets

By default, `BadgeDrawable` is aligned with the top and end edges of its anchor
view (with some offsets if `offsetAlignmentMode` is `legacy`). Call `setBadgeGravity(int)` to change it to one of the
other supported modes. To adjust the badge's offsets relative to the anchor's
center, use `setHorizontalOffset(int)` or `setVerticalOffset(int)`

Regardless of offsets, badges are automatically moved to within the bounds of
its first ancestor view that does not clip its children, to ensure that the
badge is not clipped if there is enough space.

**Note:** If both `app:badgeText` and `app:number` are specified, the badge label will be `app:badgeText`.

### Talkback Support

`BadgeDrawable` provides a getter for its content description, which is based on the displayed
number or text (if any). To specify the content description, the developer is provided
with the following methods:
-   `setContentDescriptionForText(CharSequence)`
-   `setContentDescriptionQuantityStringsResource(@PluralsRes int)`
-   `setContentDescriptionExceedsMaxBadgeNumberStringResource(@StringRes int)`
-   `setContentDescriptionNumberless(CharSequence)`

# Material Components for Android

Material Components for Android (MDC-Android) help developers execute
[Material Design](https://www.material.io). Developed by a core team of
engineers and UX designers at Google, these components enable a reliable
development workflow to build beautiful and functional Android apps.

Material Components for Android are based on Android’s Design Support library
(DesignLib) which will continue to be released as part of Android’s SDK.
Development will take place on GitHub, and stable versions will be synced to
Android’s SDK based on the SDK’s release schedules.

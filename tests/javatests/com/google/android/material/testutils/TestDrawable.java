 * Custom drawable class that provides a reliable way for testing various tinting scenarios across a
 * range of platform versions. ColorDrawable doesn't support tinting on Kitkat and below, and
 * BitmapDrawable (PNG sources) appears to slightly alter green and blue channels by a few units on
 * some of the older platform versions (Gingerbread). Using GradientDrawable allows doing reliable
 * tests at the level of individual channels (alpha / red / green / blue) for tinted and untinted
 * icons in the testIconTinting method.
